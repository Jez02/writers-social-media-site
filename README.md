What I used to create it 

To create the web application, I used visual studio code as my ide and I used php for the backend it was primarily used to connect the project to the database as well as upload information from the users as well as the posts to the database in its respected tables and columns to store the users and posts details as well as retrieve the users detail from the database to display. I also used it to interact with the server to make it flow between pages smoothly. I used html to create the structure of the page to design the layout of what the page will look like. I also used CSS to make the site look nice and more appealing to users and gives the user feedback such as having buttons. Highlight when hovering over them. I also have used JavaScript to make add dynamic functions to my project such as changing the theme from light to dark and vis versa. I used phpMyAdmin as my database to store all the userâ€™s information as well as the information about the posts which I created two tables to separate the users and posts.
